I built this markdown previewer as the second project in freeCodeCamp's _Front End Development Libraries_ certfication.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Tips for Use

Install and run using:

```
npm i
npm start
```

To Build and deploy, use:

```
npm run deploy
```
